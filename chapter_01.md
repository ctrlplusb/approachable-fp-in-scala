# Chapter 1: Why learn Functional Programming?

Well, before we go over the benefits of coding using the functional programming paradigm we should consider defining the term. The shortest description of functional programming is "coding using functions".  Sounds devilishly simple right? Yep, that is undoubtably an oversimplification, however the heart of the FP paradigm is truly the _function_.  

With FP you make glorious use of _functions_ composing them together so that your data pipes through them being transformed from one form to another until you have a fully working application that accepts inputs \(e.g. HTTP Requests\) and produces outputs \(e.g. HTTP Responses\).

Topics: Immutability, Statelessness, Reasonability, Performance.
