# Chapter 1: Why learn Functional Programming?

So you are curious to learn function programming. That is awesome. I definitely feel that there is growing interest in the paradigm, and for good reason.  It has a lot of benefits to offer over the widely used imperative style.

Before we describe these benefits we should provide a definition on the term. The short and sweet version is: "coding using functions".  Sounds devilishly simple right? Yep, that is undoubtably an oversimplification, however the heart of the FP paradigm is truly the _function_.

With FP you make glorious use of _functions_ composing them together so that your data pipes through them being transformed from one form to another until you have a fully working application that accepts inputs \(e.g. HTTP Requests\) and produces outputs \(e.g. HTTP Responses\).
