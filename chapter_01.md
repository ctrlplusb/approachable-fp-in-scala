# Chapter 1: Why learn Functional Programming?

Well, before we go over the benefits of coding using the functional programming paradigm we should consider defining the term functional programming. The shortest description of functional programming is simple "coding using functions".  I guess we know why it's called functional programming now.

Sounds devilishly simple right? Yep, that is an oversimplification, however the heart of the FP paradigm is the usage of functions.  Specifically we use functions to map inputs to outputs. We then compose these functions together piping data from one form to another until we have a fully working application.



Of course there is a bit more to it than that, but at it's heart FP is really just about functions. We'll review some of the typical concepts\/requirements for FP below.

Topics: Immutability, Statelessness, Reasonability, Performance.
